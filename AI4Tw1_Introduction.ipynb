        "3. Print\n",
        "4. Conditional Statements\n",

        "The purpose of this notebook is NOT to teach you how to write code from scratch. Instead, it aims to provide you with the basics to read or amend code written by others with greater confidence. You just need to understand and run all the code cells, and complete the challenge section at the end. Happy learning!\n"
